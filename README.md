# stardewValley
Crop analysis for Stardew Valley to help guide choosing what to plant each season. The features say jar-able but some of the crops marked 'True' are actually keg-able. I was too lazy to go back and change the name but the artisan value recorded should be the more valuable artisan good of a given crop. 


[SEASON]_Crops_Data.csv -- files contain the raw data for each crop in its respective season

crop_analysis.csv -- contains all crops with analysis metrics.
